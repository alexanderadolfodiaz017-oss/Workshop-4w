🏎️ LaRusso Auto Group Dealership Application
📘 Project Overview

This Java console application simulates a car dealership management system for LaRusso Auto Group.
It allows users (sales staff or customers) to view all vehicles in inventory, search by price or make/model, and manage dealership data through a CSV file.

The system demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

Classes and objects

Constructors

Encapsulation (Getters/Setters)

Lists and loops

File I/O (reading/writing CSV data)

⚙️ Features

✅ Load and save dealership inventory from a .csv file
✅ Display all vehicles in inventory
✅ Search vehicles by price range or make/model
✅ Add new vehicles and automatically save changes
✅ Command-line user interface with colored output
✅ Data persistence between runs

🧱 Project Structure

All files are organized under the com.dealership package.
